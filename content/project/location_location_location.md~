\#+end\_export Location, location, location is an adage used in residential property
market to stress the importance of location to a property's
value. Location is also important in FX markets, but here I also use
the expression to indicate that an FX trade may involve three
locations. Clearly both counterparties to the trade will be located
somewhere, but the third, and probably the most important location, is
where the trade itself is transaacted. The majority of FX trades are
transacted electronically on different 'venues'. In this article, I
explore how activity is distributed across these venues and how it has
evolved over time.
