This is my very first blog post! In it I will explain how I came up with
the name, Eyes on FX, and my intentions for this website.

According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), USD 6.5
trillion of Foregin Exchange (FX) was conducted each day on average in
April 2019. As Blastland and Dilnot advise in their excellent book
'The Tiger that Isn't', we should always consider a comparison, to
answer the simple question: 'is that a big number?'.

According to the World Bank, 2018 global GDP, the value of all the
good and services produced throughout the world that year, was 85.91
trillion, or around 0.33 billion per working day. Very roughly then,
in terms of USD volumes, the FX market is twenty times larger than the
global economy. To repeat, this is a very rough calculation, but
there's no refinement, nor reasonable adjustment, that can change the
conclusion: the FX market, is not just big, it's monstrous!

Apart from it's sheer size, the FX market is critical to the global
economy, trade in goods and services cannot. It's not just it's sheer
size that makes the FX market so important to the global

Despite it's importance the FX market remains relatively opaque
compared to other financial market.
