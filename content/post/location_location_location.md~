Location, location, location is a mantra used in the property market
to stress the importance of location to a property's value. Location
is also important in FX markets, but here I use the expression to
indicate that an FX trade may involve three locations. Clearly both
counterparties to the trade will be located somewhere, but the third,
and probably the most important location, is where those
counterparties come together to execute the trade. The majority of FX
trades are executed electronically on different trading 'venues'. In
this article, using monthly data published by the venues, I explore
the distribution of activity across them and how it has evolved over
time.
